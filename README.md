This tutorial shows how to use dependency injection (DI) in .NET. With Microsoft Extensions, DI is managed by adding services and configuring them
in an IServiceCollection. The IHost interface exposes the IServiceProvider instance, which acts as a container of all the registered services.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

Create a .NET console app that uses dependency injection
Build and configure a Generic Host
Write several interfaces and corresponding implementations
Use service lifetime and scoping for DI
